## Week 2/Day 1 Homework

Tonight you'll be creating JavaScript functions from word problems.

### Problem #1

Forgot how old you are? Calculate it!

Write a function named calculateAge that:

- Takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
- Calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years.
- Outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"
- Call the function three times with different sets of values.
- Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in.


### Problem 2

The Lifetime Supply Calculator

Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

Write a function named calculateSupply that:

- Takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
- Calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
- Outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
- Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
- Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.
