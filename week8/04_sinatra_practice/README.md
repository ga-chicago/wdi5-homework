# Weekend Homework

Create a Sinatra application that:

- Uses ActiveRecord models to save
- Has a controller (api_controller) that renders just JSON for an API or AJAX request
- has a Get route that uses a model to retrieve all the entries in the database and returns the results in
json
- has a post route that uses a model to save information to the database (you can confirm this 
through form submittion, ajax, or postman)

-  Create a second controller called home_controller
- Renders at least one view to display API results
- Renders a home view
- Maybe this also has a few with a form that submits
to your post route also.
